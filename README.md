# LVR-token-Gen

in this repo, i want to give anyone access to the token gen of LVR ([LuisaViaRoma](https://www.luisaviaroma.com/)). It is already open sourced, but still many people are trying to sell it!

[HERE](https://github.com/0xf6i/lvr-token-gen) it got first published in typescript and Go by [@0xf6i](https://github.com/0xf6i/)
but many need it in python, so here you go!

A LVR Token is always valid for 30 minutes, but you can also just gen it every request, it doesn't matter!

in the headers it should look like this:
```
"__lvr_mobile_api_token__" : "[YOUR LVR TOKEN]" 

Example: "st=1658805332~exp=1658807432~acl=*~hmac=e886bceea2ef815b4c01ba9ec2f3fdd8d45d63f2f15fe313d9774c4aa248bb75"
```

I hope it will help!
