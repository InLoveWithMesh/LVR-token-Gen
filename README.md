# LVR-token-Gen

in this repo, i wanna to give anyone access to the token gen of LVR (LouisaViaRoma). It is already open sourced, but still many people are trying to sell it and scam people!

[HERE](https://github.com/0xf6i/lvr-token-gen) here it got first published in typescript and Go
but many people don't have it in Python, so here you go!
